# Discord Collapsible Sidebar Theme 🎨

A **simple and minimal CSS theme** for Discord that collapses the **channel list** and **member list**, and expands them smoothly when you hover.  
Also includes a small tweak to the **bottom-left profile section**, where the **Mute, Deafen, and Settings buttons** are neatly placed.
